                            In combination with playing junior hockey, high school helped me develop 
                            the personality and many traits that I have today. During Grade 12, I learned to convert my work 
                            ethic from hockey into my studies as well as various other areas of my life.
                            This helped improve my grades in high school and has carried through in my
                            university GPA.

                            With this being my fourth and final co-op I was eager to find a job in the field I desire to start my
                            career in once I complete my degree. This role was at a smaller company so I was able to take on a large 
                            workload of machine learning, AI and DevOps tasks with minimal supervision. I quickly learned how to develop an
                            end-to-end machine learning application that involved acquisition of data, exploratory data analysis, 
                            data cleaning, preprocessing, model training and model deployment on AWS. This project was a content 
                            classification system, for recognizing relevant information of a webpage. I used TensorFlow to construct a multi-input 
                            neural network with a text embedding layer and a text NLP layer that required fine-tuning a BERT 
                            transformer from HuggingFace.

                            This role was a continuation of my 3rd co-op as an Embedded and Software Engineer where
                            I was promoted to leading the web development, mobile app and embedded engineering teams. This role
                            was focused around guiding the teams towards completing new tasks and achieving their milestones.
                            Incidentally, I was the go-to person for answering code-related and project-related questions. I quickly
                            learned how to lead weekly Kanban meetings, discussing project needs as well as developer needs. With this role
                            being part time, I was more involved in the management of people and projects than developing code.

                            After completing my 3rd co-op as an Embedded Software Engineer Co-op, I was given the opportunity
                            to continue working for the company as a part time Software Engineering Team Lead. While taking a full (5) course load,
                            my duties have transitioned to
                            managing various software departments within Inventu Research. This has included integrating the Kanban methodology
                            as well as configuring CI/CD pipelines and branching structures for each department. These departments are Embedded 
                            Engineering, Web Development, API and Database departments. One interesting project I have
                            been working on recently has included developing a Version Control interface within the Admin Center of the company website. 
                            The Version Control interface controls the 'active' firmware code files that customers are able to update their products to via the mobile applications.
                            This integration has also included implemented over-the-air firmware updates for the company products.
                            I plan on continuing to work in this position until this 
                            upcoming September 2021 where I am eager to transition to my 4th and final co-op.

                            This role has revolved around programming and soldering the PCB's for the company's desk and bike products.
                            Using C++, I have had the opportunity to program various peripherals such as Servo and PWM motors, capacitive touch sensors,
                            and accelerometers. Programming the PCB's have allowed me to better understand UART and I2C

                            From the ground up, I designed, implemented, and tested a full stack e-commerce website to market 
                            the company's products. This included an HTML/Python front-end, a Node.js API and a Postgresql database.
                            With this being my first engineering co-op, I had to overcome a difficult learning curve given the size of
                            the project I was assigned with. After obtaining the necessary knowledge, this role helped me fall in love with
                            programming. I obtained extensive experience writing API endpoints and SQL queries to a relational database.

                            Knowing that I wanted to go to university for engineering the next fall, I wanted 
                            to leave the game of hockey on the best note I that could. I decided to go play for a team 
                            that I heard many excellent things about - and that was arguably 
                            the best decision I ever made in my hockey career.

                            This was my first experience playing junior hockey and did it ever teach me a lot.
                            After learning how to play in this business-first type of league, it didn't end up being
                            something I wanted to pursue. However, the relationships I developed while playing for teams
                            such as Canmore are still relevant in my life today. I still see my loving billet family from Canmore
                            as well as many of my past teammates.

            knowledge in embedded and firmware systems. This experience is illustrated in various projects. Currently, I have shifted my focus towards 
            machine learning and artificial intelligence applications.

                    of playing for many teams I developed excellent interpersonal skills, respect for others and how to work in
                    a group setting. While I no longer play competitively, I still invest extracurricular time in intramural sports such
                    as hockey, squash and tennis, along with keeping up to date with professional hockey through fantasy leagues.
