            <h1 class="h1-title">Ergonomyx Technologies Canada Co-op</h1>
            <p class="text-muted">January - August 2019, Work Terms #1 & #2</p>
            <br>
            <p> Over the course of my first two co-op work terms, I worked for Ergonomyx Technologies Canada as a Full
                Stack Web Developer. As the company was a recent startup, I was tasked with a large work load and had
                the opportunity to learn a lot. </p>
            <p> I was co-tasked with building an e-commerce platform for marketing the company’s products, from the
                ground up. This included designing an engaging customer UI that communicated with a PostgreSQL database
                via a Node.js API. On top of the customer UI, an Admin Centre was implemented for the company to easily
                manage the website’s data and appearance.</p>
            <p> This co-op allowed me to learn many different frameworks as well as valuable assets of the Full Stack
                design. I developed HTML/CSS/JS frontend skills, learning how to incorporate various libraries to give
                the user the best experience. While also writing the frontend in Python (Flask Framework), I became
                advanced with requests via the HTTP Protocol, querying a relational database and returning an HTTP
                response to the frontend. I obtained experience working with relational databases in both a testing and
                production environment; writing extensive queries in SQL and PL/pgSQL database languages. </p>
            <p> I became skilled in the process of designing a new feature, followed by implementing and testing it over
                a set duration. This included working with and utilizing third party documentation such as Braintree for
                payments, Cloudinary for product imaging as well as Facebook and Google for account login/registration.
            </p>
            <p> The development life cycle was similar to that of an Agile SDLC. It was a continuous cycle of
                implementing, testing (through Selenium, PyTest or Postman for the API) and meetings to decide on
                feature approval or necessary changes. </p>
            <p> Upon completion of this co-op, I have nothing but excellent things to say about Ergnomyx and would
                highly recommend it as co-op or career. While this co-op came with a large learning curve, I came to
                learn that one of my greatest strengths as Software Engineering Student is my ability learn new
                information promptly and implement it effectively. </p>
