            <p>During my third co-op work term, my second main project was to write an embedded program for one the company's main products,
                the Under Desk Bike. With there being various problems with the initial PCB prototype, I had the opportunity to gain experience
                debugging and adjusting the circuitry of the PCB. This involved testing various circuits on breakout boards that the electrical 
                engineering department had helped design.
            </p>

            <p>
                As for the software itself, I implemented C++ code to communicate with the peripherals on the PCB board. A reed switch was used to
                calculate the bike's RPMs as well as a battery boost regulator circuit that I toggled via the code when necessary. A Bluetooth beacon
                was implemented to send the various sensor data to the mobile applications. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This project allowed me to better understand how the hardware communicates with the software in an embedded application. To me, I really
                enjoy seeing low-level programming output a physical result via hardware.
