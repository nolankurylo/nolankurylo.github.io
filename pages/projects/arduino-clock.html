                As an extracurricular project, I decided to program a digital clock using an Arduino Uno. The idea of this project was
                to use the Arduino's processor and clock to demonstrate a precise timer interrupt that would increment the 'seconds' count
                exactly once a second.
            </p>

            <p>
                Using the C/C++ Arduino language, I setup commuication with a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD Screen) via the I2C Protocol. The 
                LCD was used to display the current, time and date.

                This project taught a lot about how to use interrupt timers. Although I have seen them in school, this was an 
                interesting way to implement them in my own project. More specifically, I learned why I would want to use them
                as compared to the built-in <i>delay()</i> functions: precision.
            </p>
            <p>
                While this project displays the current dat and time on the LCD, I also designed a terminal-based UI for the user to configure the 
                correct time and date, as seen on the left.
                This gave me more experience in parsing user inputs and converting strings into the correct type necessary to be printed onto the 
                LCD. Furthermore, there were many edge cases that had to be handled given the various user inputs the program could accept.
