            <p> During my first coop work term, I decided to learn a new programming language and build a mobile app
                that others could use. This project was one that I did on my own time. </p>
            <p> This app serves as an IOU system for groups of people. The idea for this app came from living in a house
                with some of my schoolmates and the troubles of dividing up group expenses. </p>
            <p> For example, if myself and my three roommates were to hop in a cab ride to go downtown, that would have
                costed about $8. It makes the most sense to have one person pay for the cab and the rest of us pay that
                person back afterwards. However, who wants to dig around for a toonie or send a $2 e-transfer? </p>
            <p> With this app, IOUs between groups of people can be tracked and acculumated to a point where there is
                enough money owed to pay the other person back. </p>

            <h1 class="h1-title">How It Works</h1>
            <br>
            <p> When a user first creates an account, they are brought to the Home screen shown in the image above. By
                navigating to the "Find Friends" tab, they have the opportunity to send friend requests to other users
                in the database. While, friend requests can be accepted/declined from the "You" tab, a list of account
                information and current friends is displayed. </p>
            <p> From the top right corner of the Home screen, users can create a new "House" by entering a House name
                and selecting which of their friends they want to include. When a House has been created, users included
                in the House have access to the screen as shown to the right. </p>
            <p> This screen shows overall balances as well as individual balances between the current user and other
                users in the House. </p>
        </div>
        
    </div>
    <div class="row align-items-center" style="margin-bottom: 40px; margin-top: 45px;">
        <div class="col-lg-7 col-md-12 text-left">
            <p> When a user wishes to create an IOU with one or more of the users in the house, they can press the
                Create IOU button. As seen on the left, there are two types of IOUs a user can create. The screen on the
                left being for IOUs that need to be split with money. </p>
            <p> The screen on the right illustrates an IOU for a physical object, where it would be easier to just split
                it for what it actually is. </p>
            <p> With this app, IOUs between groups of people can be tracked and accumulated to a point where there is
                enough money owed to pay the other person back. </p>
