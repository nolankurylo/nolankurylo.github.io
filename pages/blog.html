            <br>
            <p> Since entering the University of Victoria in the Software Engineering Co-op Program, I have become
                accustomed to living on my own and learning to manage my finances without the support of my parents.
                Before attending university, I had saved up some money that would eventually be put towards tuition,
                rent, groceries and other expenses. I quickly learned how easy it was to spend unnecessary amounts of
                money on things I probably could have done without. During my first year, it became apparent to me that
                the cost of the little things added up over time and I wasn’t going to be able to afford university if I
                wasn’t more careful with my spending. While this was my first time living on my own and financially
                independent, I eventually figured out how to properly manage my expenses. Although I had some money to
                rely on that I made from before attending university, I had no income being a full-time student. </p>
            <p> Over the first two years of my degree, the money I had initially saved up began to run low as I put it
                towards tuition, rent and other necessities. During my first two co-op work terms, I was working at a
                small start-up company and decided to sacrifice a larger pay cheque for better experience. It was a
                decision that I believe will be more beneficial in the long run. Thus, I was only able to make enough
                pay for the cost of living and the next semester’s tuition costs, with no carry over. This left me at a
                break-even point before beginning the next school semester. Being back in school, I had no source of
                income for two semesters until my next co-op work term. Inevitably, I decided to take out a two term,
                8-month student loan from the Canadian government. </p>
            <p>Currently, I am in the final semester of my student loan which should last me until May 2020. By the end
                of this current semester, I will be $16,000 in debt to the Canadian government for student loans. With
                the second half of my degree remaining, I have two co-op work terms left along with four school
                semesters. Mathematically speaking in the worst case (assuming minimum wage for both jobs), I am in the
                same position as the first half of my degree where I can only afford expenses for the duration of both
                co-op placements plus the following semester of each. This means that for the remainder of my degree, I
                will require another $16,000 in student loans. Upon completion of my degree, I have calculated that I
                will owe no more than $32,000 debt in student loans to the Canadian Government. </p>
            <p> While I have determined how much it will cost to complete my degree, I have also begun planning how I
                will pay back the cost of my student loans. Recently, I have had a monthly budget set up through a
                mobile application, “Mint”, that has allowed me to incorporate my bank account and design a budget for
                various categories of expenditures. With an already existing savings account, I have tightened my
                previous monthly budget in order to deposit the difference left over at the end of each month. This
                account is slowly accumulating interest and by the time I complete my degree, there will be a sufficient
                amount of money to initiate the pay back of my student loan. Once I complete my degree, a “grace period”
                begins where I have six months interest-free on paying back my loan. To avoid accumulating interest, it
                is recommended that as much of this loan as possible is paid back during this period. By adding small
                amounts of money to a savings account monthly, I will be able to pay a large portion of my loan as soon
                as the grace period begins.</p>
            <p> After the grace period ends, I will still have a segment of the student loan to pay back. Throughout my
                degree, I have had the opportunity to obtain work experience through various co-op work terms. While
                already completing two of the four, I plan to continue to build my resume and skillset for a career in
                the software engineering industry. For my fourth and final co-op work term, I plan to pursue a company
                that is known for hiring / continuing to employ co-op students upon graduation. By receiving an offer to
                continue working at a specific company after graduating, I will be able to maintain a steady income. At
                this point, I will save in a similar sense as before. By setting aside a certain amount of money every
                month, I can provide monthly payments to settle the remainder of the loan. </p>
